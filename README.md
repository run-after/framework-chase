This is the final project on The Odin Project HTML/CSS section.(https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-your-own-grid-based-framework)

In this section, I made a very basic CSS framework.

I uploaded fonts to mock The Odin Project's look.

I used CSS Grid to create the layout of the framework.

I used a CSS reset to keep the page looking the same in all browsers.

I practiced mobile first layout and made the site responsive, just like the original page.

I didn't make any of the links work, since that wasn't the purpose of this assignment. I just mocked the page to look and act like the original.

I didn't implement any JavaScript as of now, but I will be learning that in the next section.
